# 3 amazing ML models made from scratch without any libraries, in-depth understanding of ML yo!!!
1. Arithmetic Model - finds the mathematical relation between inputs x and outputs y. Uses some grade 6 math.
2. Algebric Model - works perfectly for perfectly linear data, uses grade 7 algebra and gives answers without using any loops and complex stuff.
3. Gradient Descend Model - Uses gradient descend, but it calculates learning_rate dynamically according to data and you don't need to define iterations it automatically stops training iteration when it needs to using error monitoring.
Note: These take only one input x when predicting, so please
No heavy magical functions or math and no magical calculus or MSE, pure easy python + math yo!! This can be done simply, don't use fancy uselesss math or functions.
